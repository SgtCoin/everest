# Problem:

What is the 'parallel-fetch-limit' parameter in lotus-seal-worker run command?

# Environment:

* Mainnet
* Calibnet
* Devnet

# Resolution:

The 'parallel-fetch-limit' is the amount of fetch processes one node can do. In this example, lets say that node A is doing PC1 jobs and once that stage completes, the results can be fetched by node B. If node B has a fetch limit of 5, only 5 results will be gathered by node B from node A.
